# unity-workshop-project

Repository for the Unity workshop project. This project is a simple game of pong made for purely demonstration purposes. This project features basics of Unity scripting and scene manipulation.

## HoloLens notes

If the exported Unity program appears only as a regular window instead of environment mapped objects, make sure that "Virtual reality supported" is checked in: File - Build Settings -> Player Settings for the Windows Store Application platform.
